            "Hospital Course": "Brief Hospital Course:\n59 year old male with a past medical history of systolic\ncongestive heart failure (last EF 55-60%), atrial fibrillation\non coumadin, transaminitis secondary to cirrhosis, chronic lower\nextremity stasis dermatitis (recent admission for cellulitis on\n[**2173-6-14**]), history of pulmonary embolus and atrial thrombus who\npresented from clinic with with a significant hyponatremia,\nelevated lactate, and acute kidney injury.\n\n#. HYPONATREMIA: Etiology was likely hypovolemic hyponatremia in\nthe setting of over-aggressive diuretic use and decreased\ndietary intake of sodium.  Patient had started dieting, eating\nless salt and drinking more water.  He presented with\nhypotension and tachycardia.  Patient also presented with acute\nkidney injury, elevated lactate, fractional excretion of sodium\nless than 1, low urine sodium, and elevated creatinine and BUN\nall suggesting hypovolemic hyponatremia as the etiology. While\nin the MICU his sodium was corrected with normal saline and his\nurine and serum sodium trended. Once his sodium was trending\nupward he was transferred to the medicine floor.  His torsemide\nwas held and then restarted on [**8-7**] on an every other day dosing\nschedule, and he should follow up with his PCP for repeat lab\ntesting.\n\n# HYPOTENSION / TACHYCARDIA - Though initially concerned for\nSIRS/sepsis because of leukocytosis on admission, and possible\nsource of infection being cellulitis from chronic venous stasis\nulcers.  CXR, UA, blood cultures were all negative for signs of\ninfection.  He did not have fever of systemic signs of\ninfection.  Initially he met systemic inflammatory response\nsyndrome criteria with a possible source. He was started on\nvancomycin and unasyn empirically. On re-evaluation he remained\nafebrile with no constitutional symptoms concerning for sepsis.\nHis vancomycin and unysin was discontinued and keflex was kept\non per his vascular physicians prescription. Hypotension was\nlikely a result of extracellular volume depletion in the setting\nof overdiuresis and salt restriction as above, with a reactive\ntachycardia.  Metoprolol, digoxin, and diltiazem were held for\nhypotension but restarted as his pressures tolerated them.  He\nwas monitored on telemetry and was not shown to have any atrial\nfibrillation with RVR.  However, he had asymptomatic sinus\ntachycardia to the 130-160s during physical therapy.  This was\nlikely because his home medications were held, and his\ntachycardia improved upon restarting digoxin, metoprolol, and\ndiltiazem at his home doses.  Torsemide was restarted on an\nevery other day dosing schedule.\n\n#. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Chronic issue. On coumadin, metoprolol,\ndiltizem, and digoxin at home. In the MICU, he became mildly\nhypotensive (sbp in 90s, not requiring pressors) so his\nmetoprolol and diltiazem were reduced in dose.  Upon trasnfer to\nfloor, blood pressure was stable after resuming home meidcations\nand metoprolol was uptitrates in setting of tachycardia,\nparticularly with exertion with PT. He should follow up with his\nPCP regarding titration of his rate control. His INR was\nsubtherapeutic, so his warfarin was increased to 6mg. Digoxin\nwas continued and level was not toxic.\n\n#. Acute kidney injury: Likely prerenal and related to\nhypoperfusion in the setting of hypotension. creatinine improved\nwith holding torsemide and administration of IVF. His creatine\nand BUN were trended and his creatine trended downward with IV\nfluids.\n\n#. STASIS DERMATITIS WITH POSSIBLE SUPER IMPOSED CELLULITIS:\nWhile in the MICU he did not spike a fever or appear overtly\nseptic by exam or review of systems. His leukocytosis\nnormalized. The decision was made to leave him on his outpatient\ndose of keflex however pending follow-up with his vascular\nphysician.\n\n#. CIRRHOSIS: This is a diagnosis that is currently undergoing\noutpatient workup. He did not appear hypervolemic and this was\nnot likely related to the etiology of his hyponatremia. He\ndenies alcohol abuse and is reportedly planning on undergoing a\nliver biopsy to further characterize his liver disease. His\nliver function was monitored while in the MICU and remained\nstable, and no further management of his possible cirrhosis was\nperformed.\n\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n-Vascular, renal, and hepatic follow-up.\n-Should f/u with PCP regarding torsemide dosing which was\ndecreased to every other day.  He should be evaluated for less\naggressive diuresis if has bump in creatinine.\n-He should follow up with his PCP and cardiology regarding\ntitration of his metoprolol and diltiazem for rate control.\n-Warfarin increased to 6mg at discharge as his INR was 1.4\n\n",

She never had symptoms\nof respiratory limitation or difficult with swallowing and ate\nthroughout her illness.  Imaging was without collection.\nNevertheless, given degree of swelling, reported progression,\nand failure to improve on oral regimen she was treated with\nmeropenem and admitted to the ICU for monitoring.  She was\nconverted from meropenem to\nciprofloxacin/metronidazole/vancomycin and remained stable\novernight without any hemodynamic instability or fevers.  She\nwas called out the floor and converted to amoxicillin/clavulanic\nacid.  Given history of questionable penicillin allergy (rash in\nadolescence) she was observed for 24 hours on this medication\nwith no signs of reaction.  She was discharged home to follow up\nwith her periodontist  andoral-maxillofacial surgery if desired.\n\n\n2) Severe Pain/ Anxiety: Despite stable to improving findings on\nexam patient insistent of severe pain.  She acknowledged a great\ndeal of pain and fear of pain and initially required oxycodone\nQ3hrs.  After hospitalist explained that this would make it\nimpossible for her to be discharged and after being told she\nwould need to use less she was eventually weaned down to Q6hrs\ndosing without any indication pain had worsened.  She was\nstarted on standing acetaminophen as well as gabapentin given\nlikely neuropathic component due to multiple procedures as well\nas for anxiolytic component.  This seemed helpful and she was\ndischarged with a month supply of gabapentin and a two day\nsupply of oxycodone.  PCP had planned psych referral for anxiety\nand further discussing this was encouraged of the patient.\n\n3) Allergic rhinitis: This was stable, she was continued on her\nhome fluticasone inhaler and loratidine.\n\n4) GERD: She was continued on her home omeprazole.\n\n5) Presumed COPD: Pt uses albuterol QAM for wheezing at baseline\nbut given long history of smoking seems likely this is due to\nCOPD, in which anticholinergic ipratroprium would be preferred.\nThis was started with good effect and she was discharged with a\nprescription for this medication.\n\n6) Smoking Cessation:  She expressed an interest in stopping\nsmoking but was reluctant to use nicotine patches due to fear it\nwould interfere with her implants.  She was encouraged to follow\nup with her PCP to discuss medications (i.e. buproprion) to help\nher quit.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n- She will follow up with her periodontist to re-evaluate her\nmouth and assure things are healing.  She expressed a plan to\nfollow up with another oral-maxillofacial surgeon and was given\ncontact information for these services.\n\n-She will follow up with her PCP to discuss further work up and\ntreatment for COPD including likely referral to pulmonary\nclinic.\n\n\n",

For infections, she\nsays that she has now been on Clindamycin 300 mg TID x 10 day\ncourse for [**1-1**] courses since [**Month (only) **]. She endorses some mild\nodynophagia, but was last able to eat pizza Monday night, and\nhas been drinking coffee and eating popsicles since Tuesday. She\nis able to open her mouth, but finds it painful to do so.\nOpening her mouth causes left anterior neck pain. However, her\nsymptoms of pain centered over the posterior left mandible\nprogressing to include odynophagia and mild voice change have\nbecome worse. The swelling of her lower jaw started\napproximately 1 week ago. Her ROS is positive for weight gain\nwhich she attributes to dietary innatention. She has a L\nperioorbital headache which she has had for several weeks on an\noff, without any vision changes or blurry vision, double vision.\nHer ROS is also positive for wheezing, which she attributes to\nsmoking.

The patient was diagnosed with a resistant Pseudomonal\nUTI, and was treated for this initally with ceftazadime, and\nthen fosfomycin.

His 1st post-hospitalization dose of\nthis should be [**2195-8-28**].\n.\n# Diarrhea with hypokalemia: The patient's diarrhea was\nsignificant, and was initially thought to be\nantibiotic-associated.  He required significant IV repletion of\nhis potassium.  C. diff testing was negative, and a repeat stool\nculture (prior from 12d prior to admission was negative) and ova\n& parasites were no growth to date at the time of discharge.\nBecause of persistent diarrhea despite loperamide, GI was\nconsulted.  They recommended adding Lomotil, which was done, and\nhelped decrease his stool count.  On discharge he was having\nonly [**1-30**] stools a day, and his hypokalemia had stabilized, and\nrequired only oral repletion.  He should be re-evaluated for\nthis in a few weeks (see follow-up appointments) and if his\ndiarrhea has slowed (as his bowel recovers from broad spectrum\nantibiotics), his anti-diarrheals may be able to be tapered or\nstopped, and his oral potassium may be able to be stopped.\n.\n# Atrial fibrillation -- continued home aspirin and metoprolol.\nHe has been deemed a poor candidate for anticoagulation given\nhis fluctuating platelet counts with CLL and high risk for fall.\n.\n# Urinary retention: Due to BPH.

            "Hospital Course": "Brief Hospital Course:\nMr. [**Known lastname 108020**] is a pleasant 83 year old male with a history of ESRD\non in-home HD who presented s/p HD with fevers and hypotension\nrequiring ICU admission:\n.\n1.  Suspected Sepsis -- Mr [**Known lastname 108020**] presented to the ED with a WBC\nof 14.5 and lactate of 2.1 in the setting of fever and\nhypotension.  Cardiac causes of hypotension were excluded with\nEKG and history, and he received 4L fluids in the ED.  A UTI was\nconsidered; his UA was suggestive but he is anuric and a urine\nculture was negative.  Given his hx of proctitis, a pelvic CT\nwas performed which did not suggest a source.  As his chronic\ndiarrhea had increased slightly in the last week, c diff toxin\nscreening was performed and was negative.\n   Given the history of symptoms beginning during dialysis and\nthe recent surgical manipulation of his AV graft site (recent\nfistulogram and dilation of stenosis 1 week PTA) a graft\ninfection was also considered.  An ultrasound performed on the\nsecond hospital day demonstrated a 2cm pseudoaneurysm of the\ngraft site with a 90% occlusive thrombus.  He received coverage\nwith vancomycin and zosyn while in the ICU, which was revised to\nvanco monotherapy upon callout to the floor.\n   He was initially maintained on neosynephrine for hypotension\nfor the first 24 hours of his ICU stay.  Importantly, his pulse\npressure is normally wide with his AV graft and pseudoaneurysm,\nand his SBPs run in the 90s-100s pre-HD and in the 80s post-HD-\nhis pressor was subsequently weaned rapidly, which was well\ntolerated.  He had no further episodes of hypotension while in\nthe hospital.\n   Infectious disease was consulted.  They felt that he\ndeveloped a transient bacteremia in the context of HD.  Culture\ndata remained negative throughout the admission.  His wife sent\na sample of his home dialysate fluid taken from the session\nprior to admission to his HD laboratory.  These were negative at\n24 and 48hrs.  No vegetations were seen on echo.  Per ID\nrecommendation, he underwent a tagged WBC scan on [**2121-11-28**], and\nwas reimaged on [**2121-11-30**].  While it demonstrated a possible\nabnormality of the right femur, he had been clinically improving\nwith resolving leukocytosis and fevers, so further imaging with\nthe recommended sulfer colloid scan was not pursued. He finished\na 7 day course of vancomycin on the day prior to discharge.  He\nwas not sent out on antibiotics.  He was given strict\ninstructions to call his physician in the event of fevers,\nchills, or rigors.\n.\n2.  Atrial Fibrillation:  Upon transfer to the floor, Mr. [**Known lastname 108020**]\ndeveloped new onset atrial fibrillation with rates to 100-110.\nThis occurred following HD, and was transient.  He was started\non 12.5mg metoprolol [**Hospital1 **].  His echo was not demonstrative of\nstructural etiology, and his TSH was normal.  He reverted back\ninto sinus rhythm by the following morning.  He had one other\nepisode of afib with rate 80-100 following HD the next day.  His\nmetoprolol was discontinued due to borderline BP in the 90s and\ndue to the fact that his rates were generally low while in\natrial fibrillation.  Due to his paroxysmal AFib and CHADS2\nscore of 3, he met requirement for warfarin, and was\nsubsequently heparinized and started on warfarin.  He received\n5mg x2 days with achievement of therapeutic INR of 2.9.  He will\nfollow up with his PCP to have his INR checked.\n\n3.  Diarrhea -- chronic, [**3-18**] bowel resection in past.  Rate had\nincreased in last week and he was ruled out for c diff with a\nstool toxin assay x1.\n\n4.  ESRD -- He continued to receive dialysis through his graft\nthroughout the hospitalization which was well tolerated.\n\n5.  Anemia -- Mr. [**Known lastname 108020**] has chronic anemia [**3-18**] ESRD, and is on\naranesp.  he presented with hb/hct 10.1/30.2; his hct dropped to\n26 after fluid resuscitation was was judged to be dilutional.\nHis stool was guaiac positive but he has known hemorrhoids; it\nwas not grossly bloodly.  His hct remained stable afterward.\n\n6.  Chest pain -- Mr. [**Known lastname 108020**] had a brief episode of central\nsharp chest pain after straining on HD#2.  An EKG was unchanged\nand the pain resolved without treatment.\n\n",

Today, at the onset of dialysis\nhe complained of shaking and chills; his temperature was noted\nto drop from 97.9-->94.9 and then increase to 101.8 at the end\nof HD.  He was negative 800 cc today.  He had otherwise been in\nhis usual state of health besides some overnight dizziness which\nwas attributed by the patient and his wife to newly prescribed\ngapapentin.  His HD graft includes plastic hardware and was\nplaced in 5-[**2121**].\n\nHe was discharged in [**Month (only) 205**] for proctitis and painful stooling\nwith a 14-day course of abx; his pain with defecation recurred\nrecently but has been better in last week with anal care.  His\nchronic diarrhea (he is s/p bowel resection) has been worse in\nlast week.  He denies CP, SOB, ABP, N/V, cough. He makes only\nsmall ammounts of urine; he denies tenderness over AV fistula\n\nIn the ED vitals were 101.7, 87/47, 18.  He was given 2L IVF,\nwas persistently hypotensive, received further 2L IVF and was\nstarted on pressors.  He had a tachycardic response to levophed\nand was transitioned to neosynephrine.  His mental status\nremained intact throughout.  A UA was suggestive of UTI, a CXR\nand a CT pelvis was performed.  Peripheral blood cultures were\ndrawn.\n\nHe was admitted to the MICU.\n\n\n",

You were admitted to the ICU\non medications to maintain your blood pressure, and you were\nstarted on IV antibiotics.  You remained without fevers during\nyour hospital stay.  Infectious disease doctors recommended a\nspecial study to look for a source of the infection which was\ninitially normal, though the radiologists recommended repeating\nthis test again to be sure.  This scan did not reveal any overt\nsigns of infection. The source of your infection is not\nimmediately clear- it may be related to your hemodialysis or\nyour graft.  We did an ultrasound of your graft, which did not\nreveal any infections.  We finished your antibiotics course in\nthe hospital. It is important that you call your doctor if you\ndevelop any fevers or chills concerning for infection.\n\nYou developed an abnormal heart rhythm called atrial\nfibrillation during your hospital stay.  It's source is unclear,\nbut it seems to occur following hemodialysis.  Because of an\nincreased risk of stroke, you will be starting a blood thinning\nmedication called coumadin.\n\nPlease make the following changes to yourFollowup Instructions:\nHave an appointment to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2204**] on [**Last Name (STitle) 20212**]\n[**12-3**] to go over your hospital course and monitor your blood INR\n(a measure of how thin it is)\n\nDepartment: [**State **]When: [**State **] [**2121-12-3**] at 1:20 PM\nWith: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 2946**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 6564**], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2205**]\nBuilding: [**State **] ([**Location (un) **], MA) [**Location (un) **]\nCampus: OFF CAMPUS     Best Parking: On Street Parking\n\nDepartment: CARDIAC SERVICES\nWhen: [**Location (un) **] [**2122-2-4**] at 4:00 PM\nWith: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2908**], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 62**]\nBuilding: SC [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Clinical Ctr [**Location (un) **]\nCampus: EAST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Garage\n\nDepartment: ADVANCED VASC.

She was\nresuscitated with crystalloid, having received 2 units at an OSH\nprior to admission. She complained of only minimal LUQ pain, and\nwas hemodynamically stable. Serial hematocrits were followed and\napproximately 24 hours after admission, she was noted to have an\nacute hematocrit drop from 34 on admit to 27. She was found to\nbe hypotensive to 80's/50s and was transiently fluid responsive.\nShe was transfused 2 u w/ good response. On HD 2 she was again\nfound to be hypotensive and her hematocrit at dropped to ~25, so\nshe was taken to the operating room for an open splenectomy. Her\nprocedure was uncomplicated and approximately 2 liters of blood\nwere evacuated from her abdomen. She returned to the SICU for\nher recovery. Serial hematocrits were continued to monitor for\nbleeding, and her post-op HCT was 23.9. She had an epidural\ncatheter placed for pain control and that was effective. Her\nthree vaccinations including Haemophilus, Pneumococcal and\nMeningococcal were administered in the ICU prior to transfer to\nthe floor.\n\nShe was transferred to the Surgical floor on [**2189-2-13**].  Her diet\nwas gradually advanced to regular and well tolerated.  She did\nhave an episode of disorientation, confusion and desaturation on\n[**2189-2-14**] presumed due to an increase in her epidural medication.\nWith decreasing the dose and agressive pulmonary toilet she\nimproved.  She was transitioned to oral pain medicationsand her\nepidural catheter was removed on [**2189-2-16**].. She required much\nencouragement to get up and ambulate but was eventually able to\nwalk independently.  Her Foley catheter was removed after her\nepidural catheter and she was voiding sufficiently.

She also had a\nHCT drop and on [**2-18**] was given 2 units of PRBC and had a CT\nabd/pelvis which did not show any bleed. A repeat head CT was\ndone which showed minimal spasm of the left MCA.  Patient was\nobserved to have a diffuse rash on her torso which was thought\nto be a drug rash due to Vancomycin. This antibiotic was\ndiscontinued and the patient will be followed closely for\ndeveloping fevers.\n\nOn [**2-24**], she remained stable. Her venting settings were weaned\ndown from the day prior and the patient is now tolerating CPAP\nwith a FIO2 of 41%.

Diffuse bilateral subarachnoid\nhemorrhage with intraventricular extension without significant\nchange compared with the CT head. 2. Left posterior\ncommunicating artery aneurysm (neck: 4mm, widest point: 5mm,\nheight 8mm). A 4 mm daughter aneurysm is present at the\nposterior base of the aneurysm.\n3. The right A1 segment of the ACA is small and this may\nrepresent spasm vs congenital variation. No other findings to\nsuggest vasospasm.\n\n[**2-4**]IMPRESSION: Preserved [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular systolic function.\nMild tricuspid regurgitation.\n\n[**2-5**] Head CT:IMPRESSION: 1. Persistent diffuse subarachnoid\nhemorrhage as described above. Increased intraventricular\nhemorrhagic extension.\n2. Right frontal ventriculostomy catheter ends in the prepontine\nnear the\nBasilar artery; the relationship between the catheter tip and\nartery cannot be accurately determined on this non-contrast\nstudy. Recommend reivew of these images by the clinician to\nassess if the position of the tip is appropriate/desired.\n3. Some degree of superimposed diffuse cerebral edema.\n\n[**2-5**] Cerebral Angio: ****\n\n[**2-6**]- EEG:\nIMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous EEG, due to the\npresence of a\n[**4-3**] Hz theta frequency background seen throughout most of the\ntracing,\nwith frequent periods of superimposed 0.5-1 Hz diffuse delta\nslowing,\nwhich occasionally becomes semi-rhythmic. This pattern is\nconsistent\nwith a moderate diffuse encephalopathy, commonly caused by\nmedication\neffect, metabolic disturbance, or infection. In addition, on\n[**2-7**] at 6\npm and on [**2-8**] at 9 am, there was a generalized suppression of\nthe\nrecord, which corresponded to increased propofol administration.\nThere\nare occasional bifrontal sharp discharges, although less\nfrequent and of\nlower amplitude than in the previous tracing, suggestive of a\ncortical\nirritability. There were no focal abnormalities or\nelectrographic\nseizures noted.\n\n\n[**2-8**] CTPIMPRESSION:\n\n1. Extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage with intraventricular\nextension.\n2. Hypodensity in the cingulate gyri bilaterally concerning for\nacute/subacute ischemia.\n3. Regions of focal narrowing in the ACA and MCA branches\nsuggestive of\nvasospasm, although not changed since CTA of [**2139-2-3**].\n4. No abnormality seen on the perfusion maps.\n\n\n\n[**2-10**] CXR /IMPRESSION: Minuscule left apical pneumothorax.\n\nCT Head [**2139-2-13**]:\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Interval decrease in the degree of subarachnoid hemorrhage\noverlying the cerebral hemispheric convexities bilaterally.\n\n2. Stable degree of intraventricular hemorrhage layering in the\noccipital\nhorns of the lateral ventricles bilaterally and decreased degree\nof hemorrhage within the fourth ventricle. No change in\nventricular size compared to [**2139-2-8**].\n\n3. Decreased confluent hypodensities within the bilateral\ncingulate gyri\ncompared to [**2139-2-8**], may represent improving vasospasm.\n\nCT Head [**2139-2-14**]:\nIMPRESSION:\n1. CT head is unchanged from previous CT examination of\n[**2139-2-13**] and\ndemonstrates subarachnoid and intraventricular blood and mild\nventriculomegaly. No new hypodensities to suggest evolving\ninfarcts.\n2. CT angiography of the head demonstrates no evidence of\nvasospasm. Subtle narrowing of the left middle cerebral artery\nunchanged from previous CTA examination.\n\nCT Head [**2139-2-16**]:\nIMPRESSION:\n1. New left MCA branch infarction.\n2. Stable appearance of subarachnoid bleed.\n\nCTA Head [**2139-2-16**]:\nIMPRESSION:\n1. There is a new large region of left hemisphere hypodensity\nand sulcal\neffacement involving left MCA distribution (please see series 2,\nimage 23), likely representing a large new infarction which was\nnot definitely present on the prior study at 2:31 hours the same\nday.\n2. The early subacute left MCA infarction within the left MCA\ndistribution, which was present on the prior study, is slightly\nlarger than on the prior study and shows evolution.\n3. The diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage and intraventricular\nhemorrhage are\nunchanged. No new hemorrhages are identified. The ventricles are\nprominent\nand stable. The ventricular catheter is unchanged in position.\n4. CTA of the head demonstrates a small right M1 segment which\nis similar to that seen on the prior study, [**2-14**], although\nsmaller compared with the study on [**2-3**], likely representing\ncontinued vasospasm of this vessel. No new foci of vascular\nstenosis are identified. No focus of left MCA occlusion is\nidentified to explain the possible new left acute large\ninfarction as described above.\n\nCT Head [**2139-2-18**]:\nIMPRESSION:\n5 x 3 cm left parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Unchanged\nbilateral\nsubarachnoid hemorrhage and right occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**]\nintraventricular hemorrhage.\n\nNOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: The left parietal process\nrepresents\nhemorrhagic conversion of the pre-existent evolving infarct in\nthe left MCA, superior division territory, demonstrated on the\nmost recent cranial CTA (on [**2139-2-16**]).\n\nCT Abd/Pelvis [**2139-2-18**]:\nIMPRESSION:\n1. No evidence of retroperitoneal bleeding.\n2. Colonic diverticulosis.\n3. Bibasilar opacities at the lung bases could be atelectasis;\nhowever,\ncannot exclude aspiration or superinfection.\n4. Hypodensity in the left renal pelvis, presumably a left\nparapelvic cyst, suboptimal evaluation due to lack of IV\ncontrast.\n5. VP shunt and post-pyloric tube in place.\n\n[**2-19**] CTA/ CTP\nCT ANGIOGRAM: The vertebral and carotid arteries and all major\nbranches are patent. Narrowing of the left MCA M1 segment is\nsimilar to that seen on prior studies on [**2-16**] and [**2-14**]\nconsistent with stable vasospasm. There is no evidence of\narterial occlusion, aneurysm or AV malformation. Remaining MCA\nand ACA branches are normal in caliber. The PCA branches are\nnormal with the exception of a fetal-type anatomy.\n\nPERFUSION: Increased mean transit time and decreased cerebral\nblood flow are seen in the left occipital lobe corresponding to\nthe area of hemorrhagic infarction. Mean transit time is\nincreased and blood volume is decreased in the left insular\ncortex.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Persistent left occipital lobe hemorrhagic infarction with\ncorresponding perfusion defects consistent with infarction.\n2. Persistently narrowed left MCA M1 segment, consistent with\npersistent mild vasospasm.\n\n\n[**2-22**] lower extremtiy dopplers\nIMPRESSION: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in bilateral\nlower\nextremities.\n\n[**2-23**] CXR for line placement:\nIMPRESSION:\n1. New left PICC, tip at cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax.\n2. Standard position of a right paramedian catheter, left\nsubclavian line,\nnasointestinal tube and tracheostomy.\n3. Low lung volumes with possible minimal pulmonary edema.\n\n\nEcho:FINDINGS:\nROUTINE SAMPLING: An unreactive [**4-3**] Hz theta frequency\nbackground is\nseen throughout the tracing. There are frequent periods of\nsuperimposed\n0.5-1 Hz diffuse delta slowing, which occasionally becomes\nsemi-rhythmic. There are occasional bifrontal sharp waves seen\nduring\nthe periods of delta slowing, although less frequent and of\nlower\namplitude than the previous tracing. In addition, on [**2-7**] at 6\npm and\non [**2-8**] at 9 am, there was a generalized suppression of the\nrecord\ncorresponding to increased propofol administration.\nSPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There were numerous spike detections,\nwhich\ndid not include any epileptiform discharges.\nSEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There were 25 seizure detection\nprograms,\nwhich did not include any epileptiform discharges.\nPUSHBUTTON EVENTS: There were no pushbutton events.\nSLEEP: The patient did not exhibit any normal features of sleep\narchitecture.\nCARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm between 80-90\nbpm.\nFINDINGS:\n\nThere is still extensive residual subarachnoid hemorrhage with\nextension into the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles\nbilaterally. There is a right frontal ventriculostomy catheter\nwhich ends in the prepontine cistern. The patient is status post\nleft PCOM coiling with streak artifact limiting local\nassessment. There is a new hypodensity in the right cingulate\ngyrus concerning for ischemia. The midline structures are\ncentral. The ventricular configuration remains stable.\n\nCT PERFUSION: The perfusion maps do not demonstrate evidence of\ndelayed\ntransit or reduced blood flow or blood volume.\n\nCTA HEAD: Regions of focal narrowing in the ACA and MCA branches\nare\nsuggestive of vasospasm. The left PCOM has a fetal\nconfiguration. The\nremaining branches of the vertebrobasilar system are patent\nwithout evidence of significant stenosis, aneurysm or vascular\nmalformation.\n\nFINDINGS: There is a miniscule left apical\npneumothorax. Left chest tube is seen in unchanged position with\ntip near the left apex. Left basilar atelectasis is unchanged.\nNo new consolidation or pleural effusion is seen.  Heart size is\nnormal. Tracheostomy is in unchanged position. Right-sided\ncentral line is seen with tip at the cavoatrial junction.\nIntestinal tube traverses below the diaphragm with tip out of\nview.\n\nFINDINGS: Grayscale and color Doppler images of bilateral common\nfemoral,\nsuperficial femoral and popliteal veins were performed. There is\nnormal\ncompressibility, flow and augmentation. Flow is seen in the\nveins of the\ncalf.\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nExtended Care\n\nFacility:\n[**Hospital1 700**] - [**Location (un) 701**]\n\nDischarge Condition:\nMental Status: Confused - always.\nLevel of Consciousness: Lethargic but arousable.\nActivity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or\nwheelchair.\n\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nAngiogram with Embolization and/or Stent placement\nFollowup Instructions:\nYou will need to return for completion of  your coiling in one\nmonth's time.

            "Hospital Course": "Brief Hospital Course:\nThe patient was seen in the emergency department early on the\nmorning of [**2-8**] after falling and sustaining a left proximal\nhumerus fracture. At the time of first examination, the patient\nhad a large ecchymosis but no hematoma over her left\nhip/buttock.  Her head and C-spine CTs were negative for acute\nabnormality.  When examined 2 hours later, this area had grown\nsignificantly in size suggesting an actively bleeding hematoma.\nA CT of her torso was done showing large hematoma in the left\ngluteal region with active extravasation.  After this scan, her\nhematocrit was rechecked which had dropped from 37 to 22.  She\nwas thus  consented and taken to the angiography suite where\nactive extravasation was demonstrated at the L5 segmental\nartery.  This artery was coiled and bleeding was stopped.\nDuring angiography, she received 2 units of PRBC with\nsignificant improvement in hematocrit to 33.  Post-angio, she\nwas admitted to the TSICU where she was monitored closely.  The\npatient did not become hemodynamically unstable, but she did\nhave another hematocrit drop to 22.5 on [**2-10**] for which she\nreceived 2 units of PRBC.  Later on [**2-10**], she was felt to be\nstable for transfer to the floor where she remained\nhemodynamically stable and did not require any further\ntransfusions.

            "Hospital Course": "Brief Hospital Course:\nMs [**Known lastname 24642**] was admitted to the trauma ICU [**4-18**] after being\nintubated in the ED.\nIn brief, she was intubated HD1 through HD6, she went to the OR\nHD 3 & 4 for fracture repair, and displayed slowly improving\nmental status.\n\nHer course in the ICU is summarized below:\n\n[**4-18**]: She was weaned off pressors using fluid resuscitation. On\narrival to the ICU, a CVL was inserted. Her neuro exam was\nstable, following no commands but spontaneously moving all four\nextremities and opening eyes intermittently. She was placed on\nlogroll precautions given her T6 fracture.\n[**4-19**]: She received 1 unit pRBC for hematocrit of 23. To\nfacilitate frequent neurologic exams, she was frequently weaned\nfrom sedation. During one of these weans, she self-extubated and\nwas subsequently re-intubated. Her neurologic exam was slowly\nimproving in that she was squeezing hand intermittently on\ncommand and spontaneously moving all extremities.\n[**4-20**]: She was taken to the operating room by orthopedics for\nORIF of radius and olecranon and placed in a R arm cast. Also on\nthis day her ETT was converted to a nasotracheal tube to\nfacilitate OMFS operating on her mandible the following day.\nGiven the operative procedure, frequent neuro exams were\ndeferred.\n[**4-21**]: She was taken to the operating room by OMFS for closed\nreduction mandible fracture and jaw wiring. Her neuro exam had\nnot progressed, still intermittently following commands, but\ntypically not interactive. She had a carotid series performed\nwhich confirmed there was no injury to her vessels. She was\nfitted with a TLSO brace as neurosurgery felt her T6 fracture\nwas best treated in this manner. A family meeting was held to\ndiscuss her lack of neurologic progression. The prospect of a\ntracheostomy was discussed and it was decided if she had not\nprogressed by HD 7 a tracheostomy would be performed.\n[**4-22**]: Her neuro exam showed some improvement, following commands\nmore often.\n[**4-23**]: Her neuro exam showed significant improvement. She was\nmuch more alert and interactive so was deemed safe for\nextubation. The nasotracheal and nasogastric tubes were removed\nsimultaneously which she tolerated well. She worked with phyical\ntherapy who had her sitting on the side of the bed in her TLSO\nbrace. She remained significantly delerious but was regularly\ndirectable and not agitated. She was kept NPO as her NGT had\nbeen removed and her mandible was wired.\n[**4-24**]: A speech and swallow evaluation showed inability to\nswallow apropriately. A DHT was placed and tube feeds were\nstarted. They were advanced to goal.\n[**4-25**]: She was screened for rehab and is awaiting aproval. She\nwas transferred to a regular hospital floor.\n\nHer remaining hospital course after transfer from the ICU to the\nfloor as follows by systems:\n\n",

You required\nseveral operations to repair your broken face/jaw bones where\nyour jaw was wired. Your wrist fracture was also repaired and\nyou should avoid putting weight on your right wrist until you\nhave follow up with the Orthoepdic specialist who will upgrade\nyour weight bearing status.\n\n*The wire cutters will need to stay at the bedside at all times\nin the event of a respiratory emergency and/or if vomiting\noccursthe wires should be cut.\n\nPostoperative instructions following jaw surgery\n\nWound care: Do not disturb or probe the surgical area with any\nobjects. The sutures placed in your mouth are usually the type\nthat self dissolve. If you have any sutures on the skin of your\nface or neck, your surgeon will remove them on the day of your\nfirst follow up appointment. SMOKING is detrimental to healing\nand will cause complications.\n\nBleeding: Intermittent bleeding or oozing overnight is normal.\nPlacing fresh gauze over the area and biting on the gauze for\n30-45 minutes at a time may control the bleeding. If you had\nnasal surgery, you may have occasional slow oozing from your\nnostril for the first 2-3 days. Bleeding should never be severe.\nIf bleeding persists or is severe or uncontrollable, please call\nour office immediately. If it is after normal business hours,\nplease come to the emergency room and request that the oral\nsurgery resident on call be paged.\n\nHealing: Normal healing after oral surgery should be as follows:\nthe first 2-3 days after surgery, are generally the most\nuncomfortable and there is usually significant swelling. After\nthe first week, you should be more comfortable. The remainder of\nyour postoperative course should be gradual, steady improvement.\nIf you do not see continued improvement, please call our office.\n\nPhysical activity: It is recommended that you not perform any\nstrenuous physical activity for a few weeks after surgery. Do\nnot lift any heavy loads and avoid physical sports unless you\nobtain permission from your surgeon.\n\nSwelling & Ice applications: Swelling is often associated with\nsurgery. Swelling can be minimized by using a cold pack, ice bag\nor a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a towel, with firm\napplication to face and neck areas. This should be applied 20\nminutes on and 20 minutes off during the first 2-3 days after\nsurgery. If you have been given medicine to control the\nswelling, be sure to take it as directed.\n\nHot applications: Starting on the 3rd or 4th day after surgery,\nyou may apply warm compresses to the skin over the areas of\nswelling (hot water bottle wrapped in a towel, etc), for 20\nminutes on and 20 min off to help soothe tender areas and help\nto decrease swelling and stiffness. Please use caution when\napplying ice or heat to your face as certain areas may feel numb\nafter surgery and extremes of temperature may cause serious\ndamage.\n\nTooth brushing: Begin your normal oral hygiene the day after\nsurgery. Soreness and swelling may nor permit vigorous brushing,\nbut please make every effort to clean your teeth with the bounds\nof comfort. Any toothpaste is acceptable. Please remember that\nyour gums may be numb after surgery. To avoid injury to the gums\nduring brushing, use a child size toothbrush and brush in front\nof a mirror staying only on teeth.\n\nMouth rinses: Keeping your mouth clean after surgery is\nessential. Use 1 teaspoon of salt dissolved in an 8 ounce glass\nof warm water and gently rinse with portions of the solution,\ntaking 5 min to use the entire glassful. Repeat as often as you\nlike, but you should do this at least 4 times each day. If your\nsurgeon has prescribed a specific rinse, use as directed.\n\nShowering: You may shower 1-2 days after surgery, but please ask\nyour surgeon about this. If you have any incisions on the skin\nof your face or body, you should cover them with a water\nresistant dressing while showering. DO NOT SOAK SURGICAL SITES.\nThis will avoid getting the area excessively wet. As you may\nphysically feel weak after surgery, initially avoid extreme hot\nor cold showers, as these may cause some patients to pass out.\nAlso it is a good idea to make sure someone is available to\nassist you in case if you may need help.\n\nSleeping: Please keep your head elevated while sleeping. This\nwill minimize swelling and discomfort and reduce pain while\nallowing you to breathe more easily. One or two pillows may be\nplaced beneath your mattress at the head of the bed to prop the\nbed into a more vertical position.\n\nPain: Most facial and jaw reconstructive surgery is accompanied\nby some degree of discomfort. You will usually have a\nprescription for pain medication. Some patients find that\nstronger pain medications cause nausea, but if you precede each\npain pill with a small amount of food, chances of nausea will be\nreduced. The effects of pain medications vary widely among\nindividuals. If you do not achieve adequate pain relief at first\nyou may supplement each pain pill with an analgesic such as\nTylenol or Motrin. If you find that you are taking large amounts\nof pain medications at frequent intervals, please call our\noffice.\nIf your jaws are wired shut with elastics, you may have been\nprescribed liquid pain medications. Please remember to rinse\nyour mouth after taking liquid pain medications as they can\nstick to the braces and can cause gum disease and damage teeth.\n\nDiet: Unless otherwise instructed, only a cool, clear liquid\ndiet is allowed for the first 24 hours after surgery. After 48\nhours, you can increase to a full liquid diet, but please check\nwith your doctor before doing this. Avoid extreme hot and cold.\nIf your jaws are not wired shut, then after one week, you may be\nable to gradually progress to a soft diet, but ONLY if your\nsurgeon instructs you to do so. It is important not to skip any\nmeals. If you take nourishment regularly you will feel better,\ngain strength, have less discomfort and heal faster. Over the\ncounter meal supplements are helpful to support nutritional\nneeds in the first few days after surgery. A nutrition guidebook\nwill be given to you before you are discharged from the\nhospital. Remember to rinse your mouth after any food intake,\nfailure to do this may cause infections and gum disease and\npossible loss of teeth.\n\nNausea/Vomiting: Nausea is not uncommon after surgery. Sometimes\npain medications are the cause. Precede each pill with a small\namount of soft food. Taking pain pills with a large glass of\nwater can also reduce nausea. Try taking clear fluids and\nminimizing taking pain medications, but call us if you do not\nfeel better. If your jaws are wired shut with elastics and you\nexperience nausea/vomiting, try tilting your head and neck to\none side. This will allow the vomitus to drain out of your\nmouth. If you feel that you cannot safely expel the vomitus in\nthis manner, you can cut elastics/wires and open your mouth.\nInform our office immediately if you elect to do this. If it is\nafter normal business hours, please come to the emergency room\nat once, and have the oral surgery on call resident paged.\n\nGraft Instructions: If you have had a bone graft or soft tissue\ngraft procedure, the site where the graft was taken from (rib,\nhead, mouth, skin, clavicle, hip etc) may require additional\nprecautions. Depending on the site of the graft harvest, your\nsurgeon will [**Location (un) 8146**] you regarding specific instructions for\nthe care of that area. If you had a bone graft taken from your\nhip, we encourage you to ambulate on the day of surgery with\nassistance. It is important to start slowly and hold onto stable\nstructures while walking. As you progressively increase your\nambulation, the discomfort will gradually diminish. If you have\nany problems with urination or with bowel movements, call our\noffice immediately.\n\nElastics: Depending on the type of surgery, you may have\nelastics and/or wires placed on your braces. Before discharge\nfrom the hospital, the doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 8146**] you regarding these\nwires/elastics. If for any reason, the elastics or wires break,\nor if you feel your bite is shifting, please call our office.\n\n\nFollowup Instructions:\n**You will be contact[**Name (NI) **] for an appointment with the Oral\n[**Hospital 110270**] Clinic.

Pt became hypotensive, may have had a vagal event. Also\nmay having been having hypoxia that could have contributed. ABG\non arrival to ICU was 7.2/53/76 on FiO2 80%. CXR with possible\neffusion on left and pulm edema. IP was consulted but did not\nrecommend tapping the pleural fluid. He was weaned and extubated\non [**2112-2-24**] and did not require further ventilatory support.\n.\n# CAD: hx of recent angioplasty to Lcx [**12-22**], was on plavix\nsince. No reported recent CP. Pt may have had demand ischemia\ndue to hypotension/PEA arrest and afib with RVR. His CE were\ntrended but negative for ACS and his lipitor/ASA/Metoprolol were\n restarted.\n.\n# CHF: Pt has a hx of dilated ischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF\nof 20%. CXR showed pulm edema. Lasix gtt was stated with goal\n-1L per day but stopped on [**2112-2-24**] as patient appeared\neuvolemic. Given the low EF, afterload reduction was achieved\nwith ACE-i, BB and lasix gtt. On the day of discharge, he\nappeared euvolemic with Cr at baseline and minimal crackles on\nexam without O2 requirement.\n.\n# RHYTHM: had afib with RVR post PEA arrest, now s/p\ncardioversion and is v-paced. BP improved with cardioversion.\nHad TEE with no thrombus in OR, and will need to be\nanticoagulated. Pt has a hx of some compliance issues with\ncoumadin per OMR. His coumadin was continued with INR goal [**12-31**].\nHe was also continued on his home dose of digoxin 0.125mg.\n.\n# Chest pain: thought to be [**12-30**] CPR, CE were flat, was on\ntylenol and given a dose of morphine however he became delirious\nwith medication and further pain control was achieved with\nTylenol and Toradol. He pain waxed and waned over the course of\nhis admission but had essentially disappeared on discharge.\n.\n# Abdominal pain: Patient with increasing abdominal pain during\nhis CCU stay with increased T-bili (although AST/ALT nl). He\nunderwent Abdominal U/S on [**2112-2-28**] that revealed moderate ascites\nand biliary sludge. A paracentesis was attempted but not\nperformed [**12-30**] the small amount of ascitic fluid on repeat U/S.\nHis pain decreased over the the course of his stay and was well\ncontrolled with tramadol and occasional toradol.  On discharge\nhe had only mild discomfort with no peritoneal signs.\n\n# Diarrhea: Patient had c-diff sent but was not positive. His\nbowel regimen was held and this symptom gradually improved\nduring his hospitalization.\n\n# HTN: BP was normotensive off pressors in the first 48hrs post\nPEA arrest and treated thereafter with [**Last Name (un) **] (valsartan) which was\nintermittently held for low SBP 80-90s.\n\n# UTI: patient developed fevers with a positive U/A, he was\ntreated with Bactrim that was changed to Cefpodoxime for total\ncourse of 7 days.\n.\n# HLD: stable and chronic, he was continued on lipitor\n.\n# DMII: stable, pt maintained on NPH 15 units [**Hospital1 **] with SSI with\nhumalog\n.\n# CRF: baseline Cr is 1.2. Pt was thought to be at risk for ATN\ndue to hypotension. His Cr/UOP were trended and Cr returned\nclose to baseline prior to discharge.\n.\n# Depression/Mental status: Patient was continued on home SSRI,\nhe became agitated on [**2112-2-24**] [**12-30**] morphine and require a dose of\nzydis 5mg. Several family meetings were undertaken to better\ndefine his goals of care and personal wishes regarding end-of\nlife issues and comfort care.\n\n",

After he was intubated he had a CVL placed\nand became hypotensive. He was given IVF and neo, then changed\nto epi. He then had a PEA arrest for about 1 minute with\ncompressions and was given epi bolus x 1 with a return of a\npulse. He was continued on a epi gtt. He was then in afib with\nRVR HR in 120s. EP was called and then interogated his\npacemaker, did a TEE with no thrombus, and he was cardioverted\nwith 100 J x 1, and then 200 J x 1 to a paced rhythm. He also\nhad hypoxia with low saturations during the above event\nrequiring FiO2 of 100%. He had reported pleural effusions on his\necho. The OR team attempted to place a CT on the left, but were\nunable to due to adhesions. His inital ABG post arrest was pH\n7.07 pCO2 78 pO2 62. No CXR was done prior to transfer. Pt was\nalso given Vecuronium x 1 in the OR. Pt was given 1500ml IVF\ntotal per anesthesia.\n\nOf note he had many admissions over the last calendar year for\ndifficult to control CHF. His last admission was on [**2111-12-22**] at\nwhich time he had a Cath with a angioplasty to his Lcx and was\nstarted on plavix.\n\nROS, unable to complete due sedation.\n\n",

As described below,\npt was found to have aortic valve vegetation and infective\nendocarditis with no abscess seen on TEE.\n.\n# Endocarditis - in setting of MSSA bacteremia, pt was found to\nhave 1.4cm vegetation on aortic valve, new since echo in [**3-9**],\nwith moderate aortic insufficiency. Started on 6-week course of\nIV nafcillin as above. Cardiology and CT surgery were consulted\nand did not recommend acute surgical intervention given\nbacteremia and no decompensated heart function. Daily ECGs did\nnot show any abnormalities, pt had hypotension to SBP 100\nthroughout most of hospital stay and one episode of fever to\n100.5 a week into therapy; given this, a TEE was done to\nevaluate for cardiac abscess and was negative for this.\n-Patient was transferred into MICU after code was called on\nfloors for hypoxic respiratory failure.  This respiratory\nfailure was quickly reversed with diuresis and NIMV, and was\nthought to be [**3-1**] severe aortic valve insufficiency in the\nsetting of patient anxiety.  Similar episodes occurred\nintermittently in the ICU with any mild increase in SVR, so\npatient was kept with sedative/opiate regimen to stave off\nanxiety.  Cardiac surgery was consulted, and it was agreed that\nsurgical correction of valve was only viable therapeutic option.\n.\n# Inguinal ulcers - [**3-1**] long-standing heroin use though pt\nreports no use for past 6 months. She had been doing daily\ndressing changes at home though these ulcers were likely\ninfected on admission (6x6cm in L anterior thigh area, 2x2cm in\nR). Wound care and plastic surgery were consulted, plastic\nsurgery did not recommend surgical debriding, pt had wet-to-dry\ndressing changes three times a day which required 1mg IV\ndilaudid for pain control beforehand. Once pt completes\nantibiotic course for bacteremia and endocarditis, she will\nfollow up with plastic surgery to consider flap placement to\nensure healing. Pt had bilateral venous stasis changes and 1+\nedema below knees, in addition to leg elevation and\nbetamethasone cream, she was diuresed with lasix and had\ndecrease in edema and pain in legs.\n.\n# Acute renal insufficiency - likely pre-renal given poor PO\nintake recently and infection. Cr improved to 1.3 today, FeNa\n2.5% and FeUrea 52% both of which suggest resolution of\npre-renal state\n- encourage PO intake\n- continue to trend Cr\n.\n# Hypotension - now improved, SBP 110s-120s. Given aortic valve\nvegetation, will maintain high suspicion for valve dysfunction\ncontributing to hypotension.\n- encourage PO intake\n- monitor on tele, daily ECGs\n- continue abx as above\n.\n# Anemia - chronic, HCT baseline 26-27, [**Month/Day (2) **] studies in [**2145**]\nrevealed likely etiology as anemia of chronic inflammation. [**Year (4 digits) **]\npanel indicates likely ACI, no evidence for hemolysis. HCT\nbumped appropriately to 1U RBC. HCT stable today.\n- T+S, PIV\n- peripheral smear - no schistocytes\n- B12 / folate - normal\n.\n# Anxiety - continue home 1mg TID ativan\n.\n# HCV - \"inactive\", never treated for this. Pt had liver biopsy\nin [**6-6**] which showed fibrosis with no clear etiology for\nhepatomegaly. She follows in [**Hospital **] clinic here. Recent poor\nappetite and weight loss is concerning for malignancy, though\nAFP not elevated.\n- outpt work-up for ?malignancy\n- LFTs stable\n\n# IVDU - pt reports being clean for 6 months\n- social work",

The patient was ambulating and pain was\ncontrolled on oral medications by this time. The ostomy nurse\nsaw the patient for ostomy teaching.  At the time of discharge\nthe wound was healing well with no evidence of erythema,\nswelling, or purulent drainage.  The ostomy was perfused and\npatent. Patient is scheduled to follow up in one weeks time with\nin clinic for wound check.\n\n",

Initially admitted with hypoNA and\nhypoK, she went on to develop severe fluid overload requiring\nintubation and CRRT as well as a UTI and presumptive PNA treated\nwith broad spectrum antibiotics. Her fluid overload was\ncomplicated by SVT that prompted initiation of selective beta\nblockade and a cardiac evaluation (negative nuclear stress). She\nwent on to tolerate aggressive diuresis and was discharged\n\nBy Problem\n\n# Hyponatremia [**1-20**] to Cirrhotic hemodynamics, fluid overload\n  Hypotension, Shock with septic physiology\n\n  On admission, Na+ was 120 and she was asymptomatic. Initially\ntreated with fluid restriction with little success, then with\nTolvaptan 15mg then 30mg with increases of [**12-20**] mEq per day,\nplateauing at 126.  On [**7-28**] She was hypotensive to the 90's with\northostasis.  She was transferred to the [**Month/Year (2) **] surgery team\nand SICU on [**7-30**] for dyspnea and hemodynamic management. her\nrespiratory status declined to the point of requiring intubation\n(see respiratory failure). She required the support of 2\npressors. Despite no clear  source of her septic response, with\nsupportive care and antibiotic treatment, the patient's\nhemodynamics and respirtory systems stabilized. On [**8-4**],\nCeftriaxone, vanco, and flagyl due to her hypotension and\nworsening leukocytosis. On [**8-5**] fluc was started.  There was not\na clear source of the patient's hypotension and leukocytosis.\nOn [**8-12**], antibiotics were stopped. The patient was then\ntransferred back to the floor in stable condition.\n\n# Respiratory Failure [**1-20**] fluid overload\n  Hepatic Hydrothorax\n  Oliguric renal failure\n\n  On admission [**2167-7-21**] she was short of breath, but saturating\nwell 95-98% on room air.  She became breathless with 5-7 word\nsentences.  A paracentesis removed one liter of fluid on [**7-25**],\nwithout much resolution of symptoms, an ultrasounds on [**7-27**] found\ninsufficient ascites to tap. Thoracetesis on [**7-29**], removed 900cc\nof pleural transudative fluid. CXR on [**7-29**] for SOB found\npulmonary edema with sats 90-92%.  After albumin/lasix/albuterol\nsats improved to 94-96% on 3L NC and creatinine rose to 1.4.\nHer saturations were at 90-92% sitting, and on standing her sats\ndropped to 85%. She was transferred to the ICU where she\nrequired intubation and CRRT. On [**8-4**], the patient failed BiPAP\nand was intubated. Bronch on [**8-6**] showed minimal secretions.  As\nmore fluid was removed and her hypotension improved, the patient\nwas weaned to PS from CMV.  On [**8-13**], the patient was extubated.\nOn [**8-8**], the patient tolerated being 2.6L negative on CVVHD\nalong with BP support on pressors.  The patient tolerated having\n2L removed daily.  By [**8-12**], the CVVHD was running even. On [**8-14**],\nCVVHD was stopped the patient's urine output slowly increased.\nUpon return to the floor, she tolerated aggressive diuresis with\nmidodrine for BP support.\n\n# Atrial Fibrillation\n  Patent Forament Ovale\n  Normal EF, Normal Nuclear Stress\n\n  On SICU admission, the patient had a stable blood pressure.\nOn [**8-1**], the patient went into atrial fibrillation with a rapid\nresponse. Cardiology was consulted and recommended continued\ndiuresis and to add metoprolol 12.5 PO BID for rate control.  On\n[**7-31**] an echo cardiogram (TTE and TEE) was performed which showed\nnormal systolic function and a PFO. Cardiac enzymes were\nnegative x 3.  The patient went into intermittent A. fib.

Vasporessin was also\nstarted for hypotension. Due to presumed sepsis, the\nNeo-synephrine was transitioned to levophed.  Pressors were\nweaned over the next few days. The patient received intermittent\nIV and PO lopressor for bouts of A. fib. On the floor, she was\nmaintained on 12.5 mg Metop tartrate TID. A nuclear stress was\nnegative, save for persantine induced symptoms. Cardiology\nrecommends continuing beta blockade through her [**Month/Year (2) **]\n\n# Hypokalemia\n\n  She was repleted with KCl and her potassium corrected and was\nstable for the remainder of the admission.\n\n# Cirrhosis, likely from NASH (T2DM, hx of obesity, htn,\ndyslipidemia)\n\n  The patient was continued on tube feeds (isosource 1.5).

            "Hospital Course": "Brief Hospital Course:\nIn summary, Mr. [**Known lastname 2769**] is a 43-year-old male with a longstanding\nhistory of HIV/AIDs who was admitted with a CD4 count of 16 and\n1 week of worsening fevers, cough and dyspnea and found to have\nsputum samples and imaging consistent with an acute PCP\npneumonia episode.\n.\n# Hypoxemia/Dyspnea: The patient explains feeling very fatigued\nwith nightly fevers in the 101-103 range for 1 week leading up\nto his hospital admission. He began having chest \"tightness\" and\nprogressive shortness of breath about 3 days prior to ED\npresentation. The day of admission he had an acute worsening of\nhis shortness of breath and hypoxia which prompted his transfer\nto the MICU. This was most likely related to underlying PCP\nalongside acute bronchospasm from sputum induction given the\ntemporality of his symptoms which occured shortly after an\ninduced sputum sample was collected. He responded very well to\nalbuterol nebulizer therapy and fortunately, never required\nintubation. To protect against possible inflammatory response\nfrom anti-PCP treatment steroids were initiated and\nappropriately increased from 40 daily to 40 [**Hospital1 **]. [**Hospital1 2768**] was\nagain tapered after 4-5 days down to qdaily dosing. He was\ncontinued on Pentamidine 225 IV daily in place of Bactrim given\nhis allergy to sulfa medications. Later in his hospital course\nhe was transitioned to 300mg PO Trimethoprim three times daily\nalong with 100mg daily Dapsone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]. He was continued\non albuterol nebulizers as needed for the remainder of his\nhospital course and he was continued on supportive oxygen via\nnasal cannula with oxygen saturation goal of >95%. He was\ngradually weaned down from 4-5L/min to 2L oxygen on nasal\ncannula by the time of discharge. Mr. [**Known lastname 2770**] desaturations\nwere clearly most marked with any exertion. Walking oxygen\nsaturation levels improved very slowly but he was still dropping\nto 88-90% after only [**10-31**] yards of ambulation 1-2 days prior to\ndischarge. Therefore, he was set up with home oxygen\ntherapy/continuous flow at 2L to use at home while he continued\nto recuperate.  He was set up for close follow-up with his PCP,\n[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2114-12-24**].\n.\n\n# Pneumocystis jirovecii/ PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]: The patient had a\nsputum sample done [**2114-12-11**] which was positive for Pneumocystis\njirovecii. Moreover, the patient's CXR and CT revealed bilateral\ninfiltrates consistent with the diagnosis and he also had a\ntypical LDH elevation to further corroborate the diagnosis. Mr.\n[**Known lastname 2770**] fevers, shortness of breath/hypoxia, and recent cough\nwere all [**Known lastname 2771**] to his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was more prone to infection\nwith a low CD4 count of 16 and his worsening immunocompromised\nstate was likely directly linked to his HAART medication\nnon-compliance over the last 6 months. As above, he was\ncontinued on albuterol nebulizers PRN along with Pentamidine and\nthen TMP/Dapsone combination for treatment of his PCP.\n[**Name10 (NameIs) 2768**] was eventually tapered from 40mg b.i.d. to 40mg once\ndaily for 5 days with a plan to then taper to 20mg daily for 10\ndays. He was continued on low flow supplemental oxygen via nasal\ncannula and weaned down to 2L by time of discharge. Mr. [**Known lastname 2770**]\nshortness of breath and cough gradually improved throughout his\nhospital course. Lung exam at time of discharge revealed much\nless prominent diffuse rhonchi than his admission presentation.\nHe also appeared less fatigued and was breathing much more\ncomfortably in lower O2 requirements.\n.\n#Diarrhea: Given immunocompromised state with CD4 count of 16\nother infectious etiologies were considered with a wide\ndifferential. Mr. [**Known lastname 2770**] recent fevers up to 103 degrees were\nlikely from his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 2772**], given his noncompliance with his\nHIV therapy for 6 months, the team opted to collect multiple\nstool studies. Per OMR records, he had been seen in [**2112**]-[**2113**]\nfor chronic diarrhea and dyspeptic symptoms and he has a past\nhistory of ulcers in the upper third of his esophagus. Biopsies\nback in [**2109**] were negative for HSV and CMV. On this admission he\nhad an extensive workup for his diarrhea and stool studies\ntested negative for all ova/parasites, cryptospora,\nmicrosporidium, salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, and\ngiardia. Viral stool studies and C.difficile studies were also\nnegative. Mr. [**Known lastname 2769**] [**Last Name (Titles) 2771**] his 25lb weight loss over the\npast 5 months to his intermittent chronic diarrhea ([**3-21**]\nepisodes/week) and decreased appetite. As of [**12-2**] his\ndiarrhea symptoms tapered and he proceeded to have 2 days of\nconstipation which was relieved with some stool softeners. By\nthe time of discharge he had been having normal, daily, well\nformed bowel movements for 3 days and his diarrhea appeared to\nhave at least temporarily ceased. During the initial days of his\nhospital stay he was given some supplemental IVFs as needed, but\nhe continued to have excellent PO fluid intake so IVFs weren't\nneeded. He was encouraged to follow up with his PCP as an\noutpatient if his diarrhea returned for possible imaging and\nadditional workup.\n.\n# HIV/AIDS: Mr. [**Known lastname 2770**]  CD4 count of 16 was largely a result\nof his noncompliance with HAART medications x 6 months. After\nadmission he was restarted on ritonavir, atazanavir, and\ntruvada. He had complaints of dysphagia with his ritonavir\ntablet and he was switched to the elixir form which he was able\nto tolerate much better. He was continued on this same regimen\nat time of his discharge. He was also continued on [**Doctor First Name **]\nprophylaxis with Azithromycin and PCP treatment with\nTrimethoprim/Dapsone daily with a plan for 21 days total\ntherapy.\n.\n# Weight loss: The patient reports a 25lb weight loss over the\npast 4-5 months. This is likely multifactorial in origin\nincluding diarrhea, infection, and noncompliance with his AIDS\nmedications. Stool studies were all unremarkable and he had no\nevidence of GI bleeding. He was encouraged to consider\nsupplemental shakes at time of discharge. He will continue to\nmonitor his weight loss with his primary care physician as an\noutpatient.\n.\n#Transaminitis: Mr. [**Known lastname 2769**] had a slight increase in his AST /ALT\nenzymes which were [**Known lastname 2771**] to restarting his HAART regimen in\nconjunction with his TMP therapy. Dapsone can also raise LFTs.\nALT peaked at 104 and AST reached a high of 55. He had no\nevidence of hepatosplenomegaly or RUQ tenderness on physical\nexam. No abdominal pain or jaundice. ALP remained within normal\nlimits.  He will continue to have this issue followed as an\noutpatient.\n.\n# Dysphagia: On exam, the patient had yellowish patches on the\nposterior aspect of tongue consistent with thrush. His dysphagia\ngradually improved with a combination of oral fluconazole\ntherapy and daily nystatin swish and swallow for suspected\n[**Female First Name (un) **] esophagitis. CMV esophagitis and HSV were also on the\ndifferential, especially since the patient has a known history\nof CMV esophagitis. After rapid response to fluconazole it was\nclear that he had a fungal infection. By time of discharge he\nhad scant patches and near complete resolution of his symptoms.\nHe was asked to continue his Diflucan and Nystatin for a total\nof 2 weeks.\n.\n\n# Anemia: Mr. [**Known lastname 2769**] had no sudden hematocrit drops or any\nevidence of acute bleeding during his hospital course. Based on\nhis high ferritin and low TIBC his anemia is mainly from chronic\ndisease. Iron levels were WNL and he had a borderline MCV at 80.\nFolate and Vitamin B12 deficiency were considered but follow-up\nlab testing revealed both Vitamin B12/folic acid levels were\nwithin normal limits.\n.\n#Hyperkalemia: A few days into his hospital stay he had a slight\nelevation from K 5 to 5.3 which was most likely a side effect of\nhis trimethoprim therapy which can raise potassium levels. He\nwas given Kayexalate 30g x1 on [**12-16**] and patient had 2 loose BMs\nwith a drop in his K down from 5 to 4 range. EKGs were all\nunremarkable and he had no repeat hyperkalemia bouts.\n.\n# Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition: Electrolytes were\nmonitored and repleted daily as needed. He was continued on a\nregular PO diet with nutritional supplements and additional\nhydration with IVFs as needed.\n.\n# Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin was given for DVT\nprevention, and H2 blocker was provided for GI protection. Bowel\nregimen was given for a few days later in his hospital stay for\na few days of constipation.\n.\nThe patient was maintained as a full code status for the\nentirety of his hospital stay and communication occurred on a\ndaily basis directly with the patient to update him on his\nhealth status and progress. He was set up for close follow-up\nwith his primary care physician at the time of discharge.\n.\n\n\n",

            "History of Present Illness": "History of Present Illness:\nThe paitent is a 43-year-old male with a longstanding history of\nHIV/AIDS who presented to the ED after a week long history of\nhigh grade fevers and worseing dyspnea with exertion. The\npatient was diagnosed in [**2095**] with HIV and has been on and off\nHAART therapy since that time. Most recently, he was on steady\ntreatment for 3 years until this spring when he decided to take\na self decided medication holiday. He reports he has not taken\nHAART medications in about 6 months. About 2-3 months ago the\npatient also started having watery diarrhea intermittently [**2-18**]\ntimes weekly. About one and a half weeks ago, he started\nnoticing high fevers and night sweats. The diarrhea worsened and\ninstead of having it on and off, it became constant. The fevers\nalso continued to worsen and peaked at a temp of 103.6 today,\nthe morning of his admission. Two days prior to admission he\nstarted noticing shortness of breath with simple tasks such s\nclimbing a few stairs at home. He also describes a\nnon-productive dry cough and some chest \"tightness\" associated\nwith this increased work of breathing. He could barely walk from\nthe kitchen back and forth to the couch due to his dyspnea. He\nhas also noticed daily headaches. He denies neck\nstiffness/rigidity, photophobia or any new skin rashes. He\ndescribes some mild blurry vision when he would try to focus on\n[**Location (un) 1131**] but this would subside after a minute or so. He now\ncomplains of diffuse weakness and lightheadedness today. He\ndenies any syncope. Of note, he has lost about 25 pounds over\nthe last couple months which he attributes to a decreased\nappetite and his diarrhea issues.\n.\nIn the ED, initial vitals were T 99.4, BP 97/56, P 98, R 22, 85%\non RA with only a slight improvement to 91% on 2L. The patient\nreceived 1000 mg IV  Vancomycin, 750 mg PO Levofloxacin, and 40\nmg oral [**Location (un) 2768**]. He was ordered for Pentamidine 225 mg but\ndid not receive it in the ED. An ABG was done and showed a low\npO2 of 72. CXR showed multiple small patchy opacities\nbilaterally which were immediately concerning for PCP.\n.\nOn the floor, the patient continued to feel short of breath. He\nwas eventually comfortable on [**4-21**] L NC O2 but noticed he got\nvery winded walking to and from the bathroom. He denied any\nnausea, vomiting. No abdominal pain. No diarrhea on day of\nadmission. He still felt weak \"all over\" and had diffuse muscle\naches. No headaches on arrival to floor. The patient had an\nacute exacerbation of his shortness of breath with associated\ntachypnea and tachycardia soon after admission to the medical\nfloor. This acute episode of respiratory distress was soon after\nan induced sputum sample and thus, likely due to associated\nbronchospasms. The patient was hypoxic on labs and was therefore\ntransferred to the MICU for a brief one day stay in order to\nwatch his airway closely while he improved. Fortunately, he\nimproved significantly following nebulizer treatments and high\nflow supplemental oxygen. He did not require any intubations. He\nwas transferred back to the general medical floor once he was\nmore hemodynamically stable and breathing comfortably on 4L\noxygen via nasal cannula with oxygen saturations >95%\nconsistently.\n\n\n",

Differential\ndiagnosis includes seizure, syncope, infection, intracranial\nmass.  Description of episode, LOC without immediate recovery is\nmore consistent with seizure than syncope.  Pertinent negatives\ninclude normal CSF, CT scan unchanged without any acute bleed or\nmidline shift. Episode seems less likely to be syncope given\nassociation with headache, however she was placed on telemetry.\nNo events were found.  She had orthostatics which showed an\n18mmg difference between systolic blood pressures standing and\nsitting, and was given a fluid bolus of 1L.  EEG for 20 minute\nshowed short runs of sharp waves concerning for seizure\nactivity, and so 24-hour EEG was recommended.  Urine and blood\ncultures were sent. The 24 hour EEG study was undertaken and no\nseizure activity was noted.  Patient denied any seizure activity\nor loss of consciousness.  She was started on valproic Acid to\nprevent further seizures which she will take once discharged.\n\n(2) Headache:  Patient with 1-2 months of headaches that are\nincreasing in frequency and now associated with loss of\nconsciousness and vomiting.  Etiology unclear.  Differential\nincludes metastatic disease, migraine, tension, post LP,\nmedication side effect.  Patient has a history of migraine\nheadaches prior to diagnosis of breast cancer.  CT scan ruled\nout acute bleed or midline shift.  CSF with no evidence of\ninfection. She was started on morphine 2-5 mg q 4hrs prn pain\nwith continuation of gabapentin prn and cyclobenzaprine as\nneeded.  Pain service was consulted who recommended no blood\npatch as was considered a possibility as an outpatient.

Pt was\ntransitioned from Morphine IV to Morphine Sulfate IR 15-30 mg PO\nQ4H in preparation for discharge. This oral morphine seemed to\ncontrol her pain well and pt was satisfied with pain control\nregimen.\n\n(3) Leukocytosis:  Patient received neulasta [**8-8**]. Likely\nsecondary to this.  No evidence of infection (unchanged chest\nX-ray, normal CSF, normal urinalysis, denies fever, chills, or\nnightsweat).  Patient's oncologist informed who believes this is\nmost likely secondary to Neulasta and dexamethasone.

Metastatic disease to lung, [**Month/Year (2) 500**],\nbrain, leptomeningeal disease.  Current chemo regimen includes\nintrathecal cytarabine, zoledronic acid, paclitaxel,\nbevacixumab.

Cardiac enzymes were flat, and she\nhad no ischemic changes on her EKG. Following conversion to NSR\nshe was started on oral amiodarone and her pre-op betablocker,\nBetaxolol.  She subsequently maintained normal sinus rhythm.\n\nMrs. [**Known lastname 426**] had persistent leukocytosis with low grade fevers.\nShe had a pseudomonas UTI which was treated with Ceftazidime and\nthen underwent chest and abdominal CT which showed some patchy\nconsolidation in both apicies.  She underwent vigorous CPT and\nincentive spirometry and was maintained on antibiotics which was\neventually Cipro and Vancomycin.  A repeat urine culture on\n[**2140-5-30**] grew enterococcus and subsequently Linazolid was started\non [**2140-6-1**]\n\nHer surgical staples were removed on [**2140-5-30**], and she\nsubsequently had some wound dehiscence, mainly old blood.  The\nwound was cultured, and she had moist-to-dry dressing changes\n[**Hospital1 **] from that point on.  The cultue was positive for sparse\ngrowth of Pseudomonas, Beta strep and coag + staph. The wound\nbase remained clean, improved.\n\nFrom a GI standpoint, she was maintained on cyclic tube feeds\nand also had a speech and swallow evaluation for dysphagia,\nwhich did not reveal any dysphagia or aspiration. Due to ongoing\nepigastric discomfort, an Upper GI Barium Swallow without KUB\nwas performed on [**2140-6-2**], which revealed age-related diminished\nmotility changes, otherwise unremarkable.\n\nFollowing her diuresis early on, she remained euvolemic on Lasix\n20 mg PO BID with a creatinine of 0.9.\n\nDue to her prolonged hospitalization and deconditioning, she was\ndischarged to rehabiliation facility for continued physical\ntherapy with the hopes of returning home eventually.\n\n",
